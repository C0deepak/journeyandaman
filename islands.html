                Ross Island, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, was
                once the administrative headquarters of the British during their
                colonial rule in India. The island was named after Sir James
                Ross, who discovered the island in 1841. In the late 19th
                century, the British established a penal settlement on the
                island and used it as a base for military operations in the
                region. The island was also used as a recreation spot for
                British officials and had various amenities such as a golf
                course, tennis court, and a church. After India's independence,
                the island was handed over to the Indian Navy and was used as a
                military base. However, a major earthquake in 1941 damaged most
                of the structures on the island, and today, it remains a popular
                tourist spot and is maintained by the Indian Tourism Department.

                    The Presbyterian Church at Ross Island was a protestant
                    church built of stone and the windows had frames made of
                    burma teak. The glass panes behind the altar were made of
                    beautifully etched stained glass from Italy. The quality of
                    the wood was so good that it survived the vagaries of
                    weather for over a 100 years.

                Havelock Island, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has
                a rich and diverse history. The island was named after Henry
                Havelock, a British general who served in India during the 19th
                century. During British colonial rule, Havelock Island was used
                as a base for military operations and as a penal settlement for
                political prisoners. The island remained largely uninhabited
                until the late 20th century, when it started attracting tourists
                for its pristine beaches and scenic beauty. Today, Havelock
                Island is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the
                Andaman and Nicobar Islands and is known for its stunning
                beaches, lush green forests, and diverse marine life. The island
                offers a range of activities for tourists, including snorkeling,
                scuba diving, kayaking, and trekking. With its rich history,
                natural beauty, and adventure opportunities, Havelock Island is
                a must-visit destination for anyone visiting the Andaman and
                Nicobar Islands.

                Neil Island, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is
                known for its stunning beaches and tranquil atmosphere. The
                island was named after James George Smith Neill, a British
                general who served in India during the 19th century. During
                British colonial rule, Neil Island was used as a base for
                military operations and as a penal settlement for political
                prisoners. After India's independence, the island remained
                largely uninhabited until the late 20th century, when it started
                attracting tourists for its pristine beaches and scenic beauty.
                Today, Neil Island is one of the most popular tourist
                destinations in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and is known for
                its diverse marine life, lush green forests, and stunning
                sunsets. With its rich history, natural beauty, and adventure
                opportunities, Neil Island is a must-visit destination for
                anyone visiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
